# Vimfiles

This is my personal vim setup. Feel free to clone it and use it for yourself!

### Installation

I'm using `VIM - Vi IMproved 8.1` and I have installed all of my plugins as
submodules. If you would like to use my setup then you will need to run the
following:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/greenymcgee/vim-files.git ~/.vim
```

**If you are using a version less than 7.4** then you will need to link the
vimrc file to you home directory as a dotfile.

```
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
